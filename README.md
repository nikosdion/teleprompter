# Teleprompter

A dead simple teleprompter

Upload some [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) files in the same directory as this script. They must have a lowercase `.md` extension. They will appear in the intereface. Click on one to show it in the teleprompter interface.

Start/stop the teleprompter with the space bar. Adjust the speed with left / right arrow. You can skip ahead or go back by a line using the up / down arrows, or an entire page with Page Up and Page Down. Press F1 for more info.

## Using with a mobile device

Bookmark the `index.php` page and make it into an app icon in your home screen. It will then open full screen from that icon.

Most teleprompter remotes send arrow keys and Enter. You can start the script using the left / right arrows (speed adjust starts the script automatically). All teleprompter foot pedals in the market have a mode to send space bar and Enter. Use the left pedal (space) to pause / start the script. You may want to have both a foot pedal _and_ a remote or Bluetooth keyboard connected to your mobile device.

You can invert the colour scheme of the teleprompter by toggling your device's display mode between light and dark.
